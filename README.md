A project for the **Advanced IoT** course.

## 📡 System Overview

This system is designed for **environmental data collection in agriculture**. It includes:

- 🌱 **IoT Nodes**: Collect environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture) from agricultural fields.
- 📶 **IoT Gateway**: Built with **ESP32** running **FreeRTOS**, receives data from IoT nodes via the **LoRa protocol**.
- 📊 **Web Dashboard**: Allows real-time monitoring of data from each node through a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ESP32 + FreeRTOS
- LoRa communication
- MQTT/HTTP (optional)
- Web technologies (e.g., Node.js, Express, Chart.js, etc.)

## 🌍 Use Case

This system is suitable for **smart farming applications**, where remote monitoring of environmental conditions is essential for improving crop yield and reducing resource waste.
